Made by Jasper Walia for the Ascend mini-hackathon (tech commitee)

The theme is a Japanese ice cream store, that focuses on selling unique flavors not typically found in the states.

Combination of html and css learned during weekly tech commitee workshops and a bit of searching up elements I wanted to incorporate.
